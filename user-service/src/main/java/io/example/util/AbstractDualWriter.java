/**
 * This class is an abstract implementation of a reactive application-level dual-write transaction that can use
 * any Spring Data reactive driver and any Spring Cloud Stream binder. A reactive app-level dual-write is a
 * high-performance implementation of an atomic transaction between two systems partitioned by the network.
 * <p>
 * The message broker acts as the final commit log for a database transaction, allowing two systems of record,
 * since there is an atomic cascading fault that will cause a transactional rollback to occur if either
 * distributed system fails during a reactive stream to request.
 *
 * @param <T> is the Spring Data reactive entity class that will be saved in a non-blocking atomic commit.
